Hospitals are involved in both inpatient and outpatient care.

Inpatient care involves staying at the hospital overnight and longer-term care.
Outpatient care does not require an overnight stay and usually involves immediate care.

Automating tasks wherever possible in a hospital setting can save much needed time that can be better spent on patient care.
In the pursuit of automating the classification of care needed by a patient, I aim to see how well a Random Forest Classifier compared to KNN can predict the care needed based on various laboratory results and demographic data.

The data set I will be analyzing was published in 2020 by Mujiono Sadikin and is available via the following link:
