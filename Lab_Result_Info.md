# Features in the Dataset

I will be using the lab results provided in the dataset (haematocrit, Haemoglobin, erythrocyte, leucocyte, thrombocyte, MCH, MCHC, MCV) in addition to age and sex to predict the type of care needed by patients.

More information about each feature is provided below.

| Feature | Description |  
| -------- | ----------- |  
| Haematocrit level (% of blood volume) | Percentage of the blood volume that is red blood cells. |  
| Haemoglobin level (g/dl) | The amount of haemoglobin protein in the blood, measured in grams per deciliter of blood volume. |  
| Erythrocyte level (million/ml) | Number of red blood cells in the blood, measured in millions of red blood cells per milliliter of blood volume. |  
| Leucocyte level (thousand/mcl) | Number of white blood cells in the blood, measured in thousands of white blood cells per microliter of blood volume. |  
| Thrombocyte level (thousand/mcl) | Number of platelets in the blood, measured in thousands of platelets per microliter of blood volume. |  
| MCH level (pg/cell) | The amount of haemoglobin per red blood cell, measured in picograms per red blood cell. |  
| MCHC level (g/dl) | The amount of haemoglobin in red blood cell volume, measured in grams per deciliter. |  
| MCV level (fl) | The size of the red blood celss, measured in femtoliters. |  
| Age (years) | Age in years. |  
| Sex | Please note that this refers to biological sex and is only restricted to "male" or "female" in the dataset. |
